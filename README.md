# Summary

This project is a hands-on, real-world SQL practice designed to strengthen my database and data analysis skills for professional use. Through this project, I learned how to design a practical SQL project suitable for a resume, create and manage relational databases with multiple interconnected tables, and write efficient SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from data. The work extensively uses core SQL concepts including JOINs, aggregations, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions to solve realistic business-style problems and perform structured data analysis.
